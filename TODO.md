### 2. Poll Refund Logic for Canceled Polls
**Problem:** When canceling a poll and trying to refund, the transaction fails saying "the poll is not closed". Probably when a poll is canceled, the status goes to canceled instead of closed. The refund logic should consider canceled OR closed.

**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started  
**Priority:** High  
**Assignee:** TBD  

**Technical Notes:**
- Current refund logic only checks for "closed" status
- Need to update logic to accept both "canceled" and "closed" statuses
- Verify contract behavior when poll is canceled vs closed

### 3. Super Admin Dashboard for Poll Fund Tracking
**Problem:** As the contract deployer, I want a super admin page to keep track of each poll to see which polls has still remaining funds so that I can manually trigger the manual refund to the poll creator.

**Priority:** Medium  
**Assignee:** TBD  

**Requirements:**
- Admin-only access page
- List all polls with their current fund status
- Show remaining funds for each poll
- Manual refund trigger functionality
- Filter/search capabilities for polls
